------ Windows ---------- Running the server:

set FLASK_ENV=development

set FLASK_APP=main.py

flask run

--------- Mac ------------- export FLASK_ENV=development

export FLASK_APP=main.py

flask run

----------- Server Error --------- chrome://net-internals/#sockets

-------- After creating the model database ------- Run in the terminal ( in mac run python3, in windows run 'py') from main import db, app app.app_context().push() db.create_all()

you can see the database created inside the folder instances run the terminal again

------------- Use mysql instead of sqlite ----------- pip3 install mysql-connector pip3 install mysql-connector-python pip3 install mysql-connector-python

Create a python file create_db_file.py

------------- Migrations ----------- In case you want to add few columns to the database pip3 install Flask-Migrate from flask_migrate import Migrate under this line: db = SQLAlchemy(app) migrate = Migrate(app, db) In the terminal type: flask db init flask db migrate -m 'initial migration' flask db upgrade

run server and check

NOTE: Any time you want to make migrations just type: flask db migrate -m "added something" flask db upgrade

-------- NOTES ----------

in case that you faced an error like this: sqlalchemy.exc.NoReferencedTableError: Foreign key associated with column 'post_model.poster_id' could not find table 'usersmodel' with which to generate a foreign key to target column 'id'

In my case i have a UsersModel as a model for my database, in relashionship the model will be like this:

new_field = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users_model.id')) So, Why users_model? the reason is because the data is the tabel is containing two words: Users and Model, in every word is uppercased, so, in the database, the table should be called like this:

db.ForeignKey('users_model.id')
